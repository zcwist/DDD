Austin,Building/landscape Camo,Blend buildings into landscape begind them,Hiding the WT - Camoflage
Ali,Mirror covered turbine,Put many tiny mirrors on turbines so they are invisible,Hiding the WT - Camoflage
Max,Camoflage turbine,Turbine has a brown trunk and green blades to match the environment,Hiding the WT - Camoflage
Ausitn + Max,Wind + solar panel,WT covered in solar panels,Merging Renewables
Ali,Corkscrew Turbine,Corkscrew shaped wind harvester covered in a sheath,Hiding the WT
Max,Wind + Water,Corkscrew turbine in the air when there is wind; and submerged underwater when there isn't to take advantage of waterflow instead,Merging Renewables
Ali,Tidal chamber wind turbines,CHange in tides pushes air through tidal chamber as water passes through - take advantage of the airflow,Merging Renewables
