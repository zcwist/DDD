Nicole ,Ability to add friends on food sharing app,"During my last interview I was told that the user would feel uncomfortable sharing food with strangers, and they wished that our food exchange app had a feature where you could choose who your friends would be on the app, and thus who you would be giving/getting food from.",Safety
Nicole ,Must be a student to join food sharing app,"My last interviewee told me that she would like it to be such that you have to add your friends on the food exchange app. I was trying to think of other ways that could fix this safety concern. I then asked if she would feel more comfortable if you had to be a student to join the app. She said yes. This feature would work by making it so that you had to enter your school email address to join, and a confirmation email would be sent to you with a code that would be needed to make the app functional. ",Safety
Nicole ,Rating system on food sharing app,"This was another idea that came up to fix the safety issues with the food exchange app. This rating system would work similarly to Uber in the sense that when you exchanged food with someone you would have the option to rate them using a 5 star system. Similarly, they would have the option of rating you. This would allow for people to see whether the person they are exchanging food with is trustworthy.",Safety
Nicole ,Scanner on list sharing app that converts handwriting to text,"During my last interview I was told that the user created their shopping lists by hand rather than on a cell phone. This means that our list sharing app would not work for this user. For this reason, I think that we would need to incorporate some way of scanning handwritten shopping lists and having the app convert the handwriting into typed text.",Convenience
Nicole ,Drawers for fridge for sharing fridge space/avoiding loss of food,"This product would be stackable drawers that could be put into a fridge. Firstly, this would help to section off the fridge so that roommates would know what in the fridge was theirs. This product would also have different sections within each drawer. This would allow for the user to have different areas for produce, meats, etc. The drawer would be easy to remove from the fridge so that food would be easily accessible during cooking, and so that it would be impossible to lose food at the back of the fridge.",Convenience/Guilt
Nicole ,App that allows you to input recipes and it gives you a shopping list,"This was one of our older ideas that we did not prototype. I was talking to my boss at work about this idea and he said that he would love to use an app like this, but the one that he has seen before had a really bad interface and was hard to use. I think that we could look at apps similar to the one he described and find a way to program something that is user friendly, and creates lists for users so that they buy foods that will work in recipes that they want to make rather than just buying random assortments of food at the store.",Convenience
Nicole ,A feature that allows you to set a radius for food exchange,"During my last interview I was told that the user would not want to go very far at all if they were giving away their food, and that they wouldn't want to go more than a couple miles if they were getting food. This lead to the idea that we could create a feature that allowed the user to set their radius of use on the food exchange app.",Convenience
Nicole ,A feature on the Smart Tupperware that allowed you to cancel the timer from the Tupperware rather than on your phone,Parisa brought up a great point that an annoying feature of this app/product would be that if you ate the food in one of these Tupperware you would then have to go onto your phone and mark off that you had eaten it and stop the timer. I would want to add a feature that would allow you to cancel the timer directly from the Tupperware add on so that you would not get further notifications about this food item on your smart phone.,Convenience
Nicole ,Food sniffer +,"When looking up products that work to fix our How Might We question, I came across an item called the Food Sniffer. This product has the ability to 'sniff' meat, poultry, and fish in order to determine if it has gone bad or not. I would like to look into an extension this product that would have the ability to 'sniff' produce, dairy, etc. in order to tell if it has gone bad.",Convenience/cost
Nicole ,Extend the food sharing app to include clubs/organizations on campus,"I think that if the food exchange app were to only be accessible by students, it may be nice to allow clubs and organizations to join the app too. I know that the clubs that I am in, as well as many other clubs, throw away lots of food at the end of big meetings when they order food in. Rather than throwing this food away they could make a post that would be sent out to everyone in the nearby area that they had leftover food so that people could come and eat it.",Convenience/guilt
