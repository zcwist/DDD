<body><p><font color='black'>EK: Could you tell us about your team project?</font><font color='black'>How did you guys come up with the main idea?</font><font color='black'>How many?</font><font color='black'>And how did you guys decide the final concept?</font></p></body<p><font color='green'>S: Yeah, so.</font><font color='red'>Our project now is focused on the “Doodle-Bottle,” which is this chalkboard-ish reusable water bottle that kids can doodle on.</font><font color='red'>Our initial mission was to try to find a better way to carry like make a reusable water bottle portable because as students we all kind of struggled with finding ways to carry our own water bottles.</font><font color='black'>While we were doing user research and coming up with ideas, one of two of the insights were about children and how they are usually the ones that were using plastic water bottles, so we kind of expanded what we were looking for at first.</font><font color='red'>We saw that in a lot of the designs we were generating for our portability were focused on kids, and those were the ideas that a lot of our group members were enjoying looking at.</font><font color='black'>so we shifted our initial project proposal into trying to figure out how to get kids use a reusable water bottle more so they wouldn't be going through as many plastic bottles, which is how our project shifted to where we are now.</font><font color='black'>When we decided to start looking at how kids use reusable water bottles we came up with a lot of different ideas.</font><font color='black'>I think we had generated about 100 total for that part, and we came to 3 different prototypes.</font><font color='red'>In our prototypes, in our ideas, we were looking at things that would be… something that was new, different than what a lot of people had thought of, unconventional, something that was fun that we could see the kids kind of liking, and something that we would enjoy working on too because we knew that the more excited the group was the better the project would be.</font><font color='red'>So we came up with 3 different ideas, and right off the bat, we had prototypes that would be easy to show the kids and get their opinions on.</font><font color='red'>When we did our interviews, we focused on asking kids and asking parents because they were gonna be the people that would have the most impact on buying the water bottle and have the most interaction with it.</font><font color='red'>We kind of iterated from that and saw what aspects of each prototype the kids liked, if they just didn't like them in general where were our strengths and from there we kind of consolidated into the “Doodle-Bottle,” because that was the one every single time the kids loved.</font></p></body<p><font color='black'>EK: I can see you guys are on the right track.</font><font color='red'>That's a really good update.</font><font color='black'>Can you go back to the first one?</font><font color='red'>It's a very interesting pattern we found out of your concept clusters, so we just gathered the excel spreadsheet that you guys created and  posted on bcourses and tried to understand the pattern from each team and we intend to find out whether there's anything we can [inaudible] more.</font><font color='black'>Actually, this is the pattern we figured out from your team.</font><font color='red'>The size of bubble means the number of concepts that fit into one kind of cluster.</font><font color='black'>For example, we can see here on the x-axis, we have five clusters...</font></p></body<p><font color='red'>CY: Attachment.</font></p></body<p><font color='red'>EK: Attachment.</font></p></body<p><font color='black'>CY: And what else?</font><font color='black'>“Water Bottle”?</font><font color='black'>“Personalize”…</font></p></body<p><font color='red'>EK So it is very interesting because in each bubble there are too many concepts.</font></p></body<p><font color='red'>CY: Yes</font></p></body<p><font color='green'>S: Yeah</font></p></body<p><font color='black'>EK: Right?</font><font color='red'>So we'd like to learn more about what was your concept clustering procedure.</font><font color='black'>How did you think of this kind of pattern?</font><font color='red'>I'm not sure whether if you guys are already aware of this pattern as of yet, but this is what we got from your excel sheet.</font><font color='red'>Actually, many concepts goes under attachment.</font></p></body<p><font color='black'>CY: the bottle one.</font></p></body<p><font color='red'>EK: yes, the bottle one.</font><font color='red'>How did it help your team collaboration?</font></p></body<p><font color='green'>S: To have those ideas there?</font></p></body<p><font color='red'>EK Yes, ideas there, and the concept clustering process</font></p></body<p><font color='green'>S: Well, you mean why we chose those ones as our main clusters?</font></p></body<p><font color='black'>EK: Right, right.</font><font color='red'>Yes that's the first question.</font></p></body<p><font color='green'>S: The first cluster, we were focused on making the water portable.</font><font color='red'>The attachment is really big because we realized that a lot people like their water bottle how it is.</font><font color='red'>They have a lot of brand loyalty, so finding a way to attach the current water bottle seemed like the best place to focus our energy on.</font><font color='red'>It's hard to find a water bottle that a lot of people like, and the ones that are are pretty basic.</font><font color='red'>Everyone has a strong attachment, and we realized that if we created a whole new water bottle, unless it's a really really beneficial design, it's gonna be a) difficult to get people to switch and b) if we get people to switch, it's not really [using?]</font><font color='red'>our environmental impact because their going to be throwing out their new water bottle, so that's why we focused on that one.</font><font color='red'>We noticed that in our interviews, a lot of the people like, students liked that they had a personal touch on their water bottle, so we knew that was something that we wanted to kind of figure out new ways that we could tap into that identity they've put into their water bottle.</font></p></body<p><font color='black'>CY: The second one is “Collapsable.”</font></p></body<p><font color='green'>S: That one is just… That one isn't as insightful why we chose that.</font><font color='black'>I think we were just trying to figure out a way to make it portable.</font><font color='black'>A lot of us were just thinking how can we make something small when you carry it and large when you need it.</font></p></body<p><font color='black'>CY: And “Personalize?”</font></p></body<p><font color='red'>S: Yeah, and that one, I talked about the perfect fit…?</font><font color='black'>I don't know.</font></p></body<p><font color='black'>EK: Can you click so we can see more?</font><font color='red'>Ok, so there are about 20.</font></p></body<p><font color='red'>S: Hmm yeah, so these ones were playing with different types of materials and ways that we can make water bottles fit into weird spaces.</font><font color='black'>So there are two ideas we had to make it portable.</font><font color='red'>You can either attach it to something, you can make it so it gets small, so you don't have to worry about where it fits, it just fits or make it a perfect fit it can kind of fit into a big backpack or wherever you want it because our main focus group here is students.</font></p></body<p><font color='red'>EK: Have you guys ever thought that the number of clusters here are too small or too many?</font></p></body<p><font color='green'>S: Here?</font></p></body<p><font color='red'>EK: Yeah.</font></p></body<p><font color='green'>S: I can see how that's possible.</font><font color='red'>I think it's because we had so many… I think that we were more focused than…</font></p></body<p><font color='red'>EK: Before you guys actually did clustering, you guys were focused right?</font></p></body<p><font color='red'>S: We were pretty focused because we knew wanted it to be portable.</font><font color='black'>Because we kind of knew that right off the bat from the first interviews, we knew it had to be that area.</font><font color='red'>I think  we were trying to figure out the best ways to implement instead of design ideas.</font></p></body<p><font color='red'>EK: Great, that makes sense.</font><font color='black'>(To Chengwei) Can you go to the second iteration?</font><font color='black'>So this the pattern out of your second iteration.</font></p></body<p><font color='green'>S: Yeah</font></p></body<p><font color='red'>EK: Can you just see this right now, and just give us some first impressions?</font><font color='red'>Like what do you think about those patterns?</font></p></body<p><font color='green'>S: Well, I think that..</font><font color='black'>I'm going to bring my human notion into it.</font><font color='red'>This one was a lot more fun to brainstorm for because we didn't have a preconceived idea of where we saw the project going exactly, so it was fun because we got to come up with a lot of random ideas.</font><font color='red'>I can see here it looks like it's similar, or we have a lot of similar… like a big range of where we see our projects, so that improvement is really big and our sets are different, so I'm wondering if that doesn't make sense.because I think this right after we switched right?</font></p></body<p><font color='black'>EK: So actually, just tell me a little more about this graph.</font><font color='black'>So on the x-axis are the names of the clusters coming from your team.</font><font color='black'>Whereas the y-axis, the labels are coming from machine learning, from the algorithm we developed.</font><font color='red'>For example, the bubble under design improvement on the very left edge, actually divides into more than five clusters based on our algorithm, which includes: “bottle,” “sock and bottle”, “kids, backpack”, “doodle, scrubbie,” so this was supposed to be a much larger bubble, but we split them into different bubbles.</font></p></body<p><font color='green'>S: Oh, I see.</font></p></body<p><font color='black'>EK: This is the name from your team, and all the concepts under “design improvement,” was supposed to be much larger than this, but the machine actually put them into a much larger bucket.</font></p></body<p><font color='green'>S: Oh, I see.</font></p></body<p><font color='red'>EK: So just as a first impression, we've come up with different labels than yours, which is “Socks.” I don't know.</font><font color='black'>Maybe some concepts are related to socks, maybe?</font><font color='black'>And “Kids, backpack,” and “doodle, scrubbie.”</font></p></body<p><font color='red'>S: Ok for those ones.. Ok for the first one, we had most of our clusters… we weren't thinking about the technical aspects, like how it was actually going to work.</font><font color='black'>And this is kind of [inaudible] we knew was going to be possible.</font><font color='red'>And this is more like we were thinking of the actually components out of all of them, right?</font><font color='red'>Like it's separating the human clusters into the components..</font><font color='black'>I guess?</font></p></body<p><font color='black'>EK: Possibly… We don't know.</font><font color='black'>We don't know how the machine does it.</font><font color='black'>That's a possibility.</font><font color='black'>The machine probably put them into different buckets with different aspects of components…</font></p></body<p><font color='green'>S: Cool.</font><font color='red'>I like how it makes the “Design Improvement,” group smaller because that's kind of a big category we described, while the rest of them are a little more specified.</font></p></body<p><font color='black'>CY: That's one of our goals.</font><font color='red'>"Design Improvements" is so general and abstract and try to give more specific details.</font></p></body<p><font color='black'>EK: Can you go back to the first one?</font><font color='red'>So this is… for example, a lot of concepts don't come from the first concept you got at the beginning, but you go through a process to combine and refine the concepts and putting different… like 3 or 4 together and create a totally new one.</font><font color='red'>In that sense, having clusters is so important, we believe.</font><font color='red'>This is our research motivation.</font><font color='red'>It was too general for our perspective to have four buckets for 100 concepts, so we knew there has to be some other way to improve the process.</font></p></body<p><font color='red'>S: It's good</font></p></body<p><font color='black'>EK.</font><font color='red'>(To Chengwei) Do we have the one to double the number from 5 to 10 to 15?</font><font color='red'>To increase the number of machine clusters.</font></p></body<p><font color='red'>CY: Oh yes.</font></p></body<p><font color='black'>EK: So this is from the previous one, the big bubbles.</font><font color='red'>We increased the number of clusters by machine learning from 5 to 10 on the y-axis.</font><font color='red'>And this is how the pattern looks like differently from yours.</font><font color='black'>I don't know, what do you think about this?</font><font color='green'>Just.. there is no right or wrong answer.</font><font color='red'>We just want your first impression.</font></p></body<p><font color='green'>S: Where...Which one is this?</font><font color='black'>The first one or the second one?</font></p></body<p><font color='black'>EK, CY: The first one.</font></p></body<p><font color='red'>S: Yeah, this looks really good.</font></p></body<p><font color='black'>EK: In terms of…?</font></p></body<p><font color='red'>S: I think that it separates it better than the first plot, the five plot.</font><font color='black'>What's the different between “bottle, water,” and “bottle, bag?”</font></p></body<p><font color='red'>EK: Maybe the concept under “bottle, water” is talking more about water, whereas the other cluster is talking about the form factor like a backpack something like that.</font><font color='black'>This is why the machine separated that out into two different buckets, “water,” and “bag.”</font></p></body<p><font color='red'>S; Ok, so bag is maybe in “attachments” it means like backpack bag and in “perfect fit”, it could be talking about the bag's shape, or how it would fit better in my bag.</font><font color='black'>So “bottle, bag” would be more how it fits?</font></p></body<p><font color='red'>EK: Or the concept you guys created may be talking more about the form factor of the bag.</font></p></body<p><font color='green'>S: Does this [inaudible[ one mean that those two are the main criteria?</font></p></body<p><font color='red'>EK: Yes</font></p></body<p><font color='green'>S: Does order matter?</font></p></body<p><font color='red'>EK: Yes, order matters a little bit.</font><font color='red'>Maybe you are pretty much talking about bottles first and then maybe water or bag.</font></p></body<p><font color='green'>S: Oh, I see.</font><font color='red'>Yeah, I think this makes it a lot easier to see all the different ideas.</font><font color='red'>I think it would also be interesting to see if one person wrote all of the ideas versus having 10 people write it because people use different language, so that might be interesting to see.</font><font color='black'>If it can be rephrased by one person, just to see if the clusters are capping at the right things, you know?</font><font color='red'>But it separates it a lot easier.</font><font color='red'>Like seeing how which ones in here have those ideas, you know?</font><font color='black'>Which ideas correlate with what aspect we are trying to convey if that makes sense.</font><font color='red'>It might be easier to mix and match ideas.</font></p></body<p><font color='black'>EK: Can you go to the one with 15?</font><font color='red'>Ok, so even harder, we created 15 different clusers.</font></p></body<p><font color='green'>S: Really?</font><font color='red'>Oh my god.</font></p></body<p><font color='black'>EK: So how about this one?</font><font color='red'>Is it better?</font></p></body<p><font color='red'>S: I like looking at it better, but then I think it's  harder when you get to that many, especially when you get to the three bottles to know what exactly the x-axis is talking about, but I think that could be solved, if the vocabulary somebody is using in all the ideas is the same.</font><font color='black'>Because every time I say “water bottle,” I might say “reusable water bottle.”</font></p></body<p><font color='red'>EK: Oh okay, so it depends on the members.</font></p></body<p><font color='green'>S: Exactly.</font><font color='green'>Or I know in some of mine, I would even just put “WB,” because I was trying to type in “water bottle,” which could have messed up the results.</font></p></body<p><font color='black'>CY: Maybe algorithm can't recognize “WB.”</font></p></body<p><font color='red'>EK: But that might be really good future research.</font><font color='black'>Maybe get the nuance from each member and modify it a little bit to make the common terminology.</font><font color='red'>That's a really good insight.</font><font color='red'>Great!</font><font color='black'>So your final concept, do you think your final concept belonged to one of these bubbles or is totally new.</font></p></body<p><font color='green'>S: What do you mean.</font></p></body<p><font color='red'>EK The concept you guys have right now, do you think it may fit one of those bubbles.</font></p></body<p><font color='green'>S: the first ones?</font></p></body<p><font color='black'>EK: Or any of  the ones you saw today.</font></p></body<p><font color='red'>S: I think a good thing about our concept is that it takes in a lot parts of these.</font><font color='red'>Like ours is focused on temperature would be one.</font><font color='black'>[Inaudible].</font><font color='green'>We also would want..for it to be fun, but that's not a good answer.</font><font color='black'>That's where I see it fitting most out of all of these, but that's not the main focus of our product.</font><font color='black'>Can I see the second sheet?</font></p></body<p><font color='black'>EK: The second?</font><font color='black'>Oh you mean the first one.</font><font color='black'>(Switches the graph)</font></p></body<p><font color='green'>S: Oh wait go back to the second.</font><font color='red'>[Inaudible] “Design Improvements.” We want it to trend, but we want it to personalize.</font><font color='red'>That's where it would fit the best here.</font></p></body<p><font color='black'>EK: So can you point out where... so between trend and then?</font></p></body<p><font color='green'>S: Probably like… we want to focus on temperature and we want to focus on trends.</font></p></body<p><font color='red'>EK: Both ok, so like here.</font></p></body<p><font color='red'>S: Cleaning too… and losing is pretty essential too because we want to make sure that it's personalized</font></p></body<p><font color='red'>EK Wow, so this basically all of these concepts.</font></p></body<p><font color='red'>S: We tried to find one that's like in between them all, so it helps the kid the most.</font></p></body<p><font color='black'>EK: Can you go back to the first one?</font><font color='green'>So it might be hard to find a concept that fits one of these bubbles because it's so general.</font></p></body<p><font color='red'>S: Well, it would definitely be in personalized.</font></p></body<p><font color='black'>EK: So you selected one big chunk, and then moved onto the next iteration of concept clustering, right?</font></p></body<p><font color='green'>S: Yeah, and in the next one, we needed to worry more about what we need in finishing it being personalized.</font><font color='red'>We need it to be safe for kids.</font><font color='red'>Cold water helps them drink more... things like that.</font><font color='green'>We wanted like a stop.. Oh nevermind, I read that wrong.</font><font color='red'>We wanted like a stop-top.</font></p></body<p><font color='black'>EK: Right, I think this is it.</font><font color='black'>Any other questions?</font></p></body<p><font color='red'>CY: This was very meaningful.</font></p></body<p><font color='black'>EK: Any other comment.</font><font color='black'>I know this is very preliminary research.</font><font color='red'>We are trying to find out where the opportunity for this is.</font><font color='red'>For example, we want to know how to approach how to narrow the number of clusters from many too small.</font><font color='black'>Other teams came up with 20 clusters, which is too scattered.</font><font color='red'>What if machine learning can help them to put them in less than 10 clusters not 20.</font><font color='black'>This is our effort.</font><font color='black'>It is an ongoing research project.</font><font color='red'>Do you have any comment or how would you improve this tool?</font><font color='red'>Where would there be more opportunity, based on your experience with concept clustering, your team members and people in your class?</font></p></body<p><font color='red'>S: The best constructive thing I could say is what I was saying earlier.</font><font color='red'>Other than that, I think this is a really cool tool.</font><font color='red'>I kind of remember seeing really big bubbles when you guys presented to our group the first time, and I wasn't sure if that was bad or something, but talking it over with you, it's really helpful to see how in the first iteration they were really big and then how they got smaller and different as it when on.</font><font color='red'>It was just really cool to understand the research part.</font></p></body<p><font color='red'>EK: Thank you.</font></p></body
